        <strong>Varity of Android sensor types listed by Android Authority, which include the following:</strong><br/><br/>
        Environmental Sensors measuring conditions such as:<br/>
        <ul>
          <li>Air Temperature</li>
          <li>Pressure</li>
          <li>Humidity</li>
          <li>Ambient Light Levels</li>
        </ul><br/>
        Sensors measuring a device's physical position, like:<br/>
        <ul>
          <li>Proximity to Objects</li>
          <li>Geomagnetic Field Detection</li>
        </ul><br/>
        Sensors mesuring a device's motion, including:<br/>
        <ul>
          <li>Accelerometers</li>
          <li>Gravity Sensors</li>
          <li>Guroscopes</li>
          <li>Rotation Vector Sensors</li>
        </ul><br/>
        These sensors can either be hardware-based, where physical components are built into the device for the purpose of each sensor, or software-based, which collects data from multiple sensors from the hardware. This source also cover examples on how to communicate with each sensor and their respective listeners.<br /><br/>

        Motion sensors in iOS devices function rather differently than Andriod devices, but still perform a lot of the same tasks at about the same level as its counterpart. 
        In fact, the hardware can be so percise as to create a Virtual Reality experience for some users. Most iOS devices are equipped with three sensors:<br/>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Accelerometer. </strong>Measures non-gravitational acceleration along the X, Y or Z axes.</li>
          <li><strong>Gyroscope. </strong>Measures device rotation with respect to Earth gravity.</li>
          <li><strong>Magnetometer. </strong>Measures the strength of the magnetic field surrounding the device.</li>
        </ul><br/>
        All three of these sensors are handled through the <strong>CMMotionManager </strong>class. This makes programming in this environment much simpler when handling sensor projects.<br/><br/>

        This article walks their reader through six steps on how to test their Android motion sensors. 
        The specific components that will be tested in this case will be <strong>Accelerometer</strong> and <strong>Gyroscope</strong>. 
        Here are the ordered steps to change the mobile device's screen color as it's moved around in different situations:<br /><br/>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Create a New Project</strong> in Android Studio with Java as the programming language.</li>
          <li><strong>Add features in the AndroidMainfest.xml file</strong> to add the requirement of the physical sensors needed for this project.</li>
          <li><strong>Add code to the activity_main.xml file</strong> to update the output formatting.</li>
          <li><strong>Add functions to the Accelerometer.java file</strong> to add the listeners to for the Accelerometer and methods for responses to motion engagement.</li>
          <li><strong>Add functions to the Gyroscope.java file</strong> to add the listeners to for the Gyroscope and methods for responses to motion engagement.</li>
          <li><strong>Add functions to the MainActivity.java file</strong> to add the actions to carry out in reponse to engagement of the Accelerometer.java and Gyroscope.java files.</li>
